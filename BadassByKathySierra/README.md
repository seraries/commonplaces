# Notes from Kathy Sierra's **Badass: Making Users Awesome**

Kathy Sierra is a total Rock Star. Besides developing the Head First series which has helped numerous coders and coders-to-be, she has also authored this book which is so worth reading for the experience of witnessing an educator practice what she preaches. The notes below are a brief summary and highlights from the book, but they cannot do justice to the *experience* of reading the book, through which you can see exactly how to do what she prescribes. Plus, it's funny as hell. (I don't know why hell is funny--don't ask--that's just an expression I like.) So the notes below will be handy reminders of the nuggets of wisdom she shares, but they'll be more meaningful *after* reading [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019).

## Why should we make our users badass?

Short answer: Because this is what drives the success of our product; what makes it desirable to our audience.

Long answer: We want our tool to make our users badass at the context for which they are using our tool (e.g., if we have an education app, we want to make our users *awesome* at the skills they are using our app to learn) because this is what makes users recommend our tool/app to everyone they know (and those they don't know). It also makes our app speak for itself when others see the awesome work these users have done with the aid of our tool.

## What is "badass"?

"Badass" means expertise. Badass users are users who excel at the context they care about. A badass user of a photography app is a badass (expert) photographer. We want to help the users of our tool develop expertise at whatever they are using our tool *for*.

## Okay, but *how* do I make my app's users badass?

The first step is to put your users first; think about them before you think about your "brand" or your business. As Kathy Sierra says, "If we **really** care about our users, we'll help them do what **they** want, not what *we* want."

Once you've made that cognitive and motivational shift, you're ready to re-think your product so that *its purpose* is making your users badass at the context they care about (the goal that is motivating them to use your app in the first place).

## Great, I'm psyched. So how do I do that last thing you said?

There are three major aspects of making our users badass. They each have subcomponents. A fancy-dancy outline would look something like this:

- Help Them Actually Get Better
    - Help them practice right
    - Help them get exposure to the right things
- Help Them Keep Wanting to Get Better
    - Focus on what makes them stop (roadblocks they'll face)
    - Help them with progress and payoffs
- Reduce Cognitive Resource Leaks

Excited? I am. Let's go into more details about each of these below!

## Help Them Actually Get Better

### Help them practice right

### Help them get exposure to the right things

## Help Them Keep Wanting to Get Better

### Focus on what makes them stop

Our two main enemies here are the Gap of Suck and the Gap of Disconnect.
