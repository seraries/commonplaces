# Notes from Kathy Sierra's **Badass: Making Users Awesome**

Kathy Sierra is a total Rock Star. Besides developing the Head First series which has helped numerous coders and coders-to-be, she has also authored this book which is so worth reading for the experience of witnessing an educator practice what she preaches. The notes below are a brief summary and highlights from the book, but they cannot do justice to the *experience* of reading the book, through which you can see exactly how to do what she prescribes. Plus, it's funny as hell. (I don't know why hell is funny--don't ask--that's just an expression I like.) So the notes below will be handy reminders of the nuggets of wisdom she shares, but they'll be more meaningful *after* reading [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019).

N.B.: I use the words "app", "tool", and "product" interchangeably. They all refer to whatever you are making that you want to provide to the world.

## Why should we make our users badass?

Short answer: Because this is what drives the success of our product; what makes it desirable to our audience.

Long answer: We want our tool to make our users badass at the context for which they are using our tool (e.g., if we have an education app, we want to make our users *awesome* at the skills they are using our app to learn) because this is what makes users recommend our tool/app to everyone they know (and those they don't know). It also makes our app speak for itself when others see the awesome work these users have done with the aid of our tool.

## What is "badass"?

"Badass" means expertise. Badass users are users who excel at the context they care about. A badass user of a photography app is a badass (expert) photographer. We want to help the users of our tool develop expertise at whatever they are using our tool *for*.

## Okay, but *how* do I make my app's users badass?

The first step is to put your users first; think about them before you think about your "brand" or your business. As Kathy Sierra says, "If we **really** care about our users, we'll help them do what **they** want, not what *we* want."

Once you've made that cognitive and motivational shift, you're ready to re-think your product so that *its purpose* is making your users badass at the context they care about (the goal that is motivating them to use your app in the first place).

## Great, I'm psyched. So how do I do that last thing you said?

There are three major aspects of making our users badass. They each have subcomponents. A fancy-dancy outline would look something like this:

- Help Them Actually Get Better
    - Help them practice right
    - Help them get exposure to the right things
- Help Them Keep Wanting to Get Better
    - Focus on what makes them stop (roadblocks they'll face)
    - Help them with progress and payoffs
- Reduce Cognitive Resource Leaks

Excited? I am. Let's go into more details about each of these below!

## Help Them Actually Get Better

### Help them practice right

### Help them get exposure to the right things

## Help Them Keep Wanting to Get Better

Spoiler alert: intrinsic lack of motivation is usually not the reason users stop using our app, or stop improving at their given context. Most of our users are already motivated to become good at whatever they've chosen to use our tool to help them do. E.g., if you have a task management tool you are offering, your user has chosen to get that tool *because* they **want** to get better at task management. They've already got a healthy dose of motivation. When their motivation to get better at task management flags, it's not because they don't care about it anymore, it's because of one (or more) of three things:

- unanticipated difficulties ("Jeez, I didn't think it'd be this hard!")
- loss of vision ("How is it that I'm going to get better at this?")
- not enough cognitive resources due to leaks ("I just can't seem to make progress or focus enough to get this done!")

Our knee-jerk reaction to seeing users' motivation decline is to try and up the incentives: "This is so totally worth doing!! Hang in there! Look at how bright the light at the end of the tunnel is! Don't you want that? Yeah, you do. You just need to want it more, and then you'll become badass!"

This is an understandable response, but also a totally misguided (aka, useless) one. Instead, we should:

### Focus on what makes them stop

Our users are motivated, excited, and ready to go! Then they start using our tool, and start trying to become awesome at some endeavor, and "Splat!", it happens. They've fallen into a pit, and can't seem to get out. The two main places they fall into are *the Gap of Suck* and *the Gap of Disconnect*.

#### The Gap of Suck

Problem:
> I really want to be good at managing my time. I bought this app that's supposed to help me track how I spend my time, so I can start using my time more efficiently. I've been using it a week now and I still don't seem to feel any more relaxed, or efficient, or good at time management. I guess I'm just not the kind of person who can be good at this. Or maybe my life is just one that is hopelessly out of control. I give up.

Solution:
> Prepare users for how difficult the endeavor is *before* they start using your tool. Give them a clear picture of what the path to progress looks like, what kind of timeline is realistic, and assure them that struggling on the road to expertise is **totally normal, expected, and not a big deal**. Anticipate and acknowledge all the potential difficulties and roadblocks they may face. Compensate for the inability of your users to let you know immediately what they are struggling with by speaking to your user as if you were there when they make that face of frustration and discouragement. Sure, some users may not struggle at every point where they potentially could, but it's better to err on the side of compensating. If they are breezing through a trouble spot, they'll feel pretty awesome for doing so good right now; and if they are struggling at that spot, they'll be encouraged by your feedback. Always remind users that the struggles they will face are *typical* and *temporary*. And if part of the struggle they face is not just because of the context, but also because of some deficiency in your tool, then **tell them!** If you are honest with your users, their trust in you and your app goes way up.

To get ideas of what common roadblocks are for a given context, look at online forums related to that context, or user reviews and feedback for tools that are similar in purpose to the one you are providing. This can give you a clue about which issues you need to compensate for and address.

#### The Gap of Disconnect

Problem:
> I've been using this app religiously for two weeks now, but the only thing it seems to care about is that I keep using it! I check in everyday and record how I'm spending my time and it sends me little notifications about how awesome I am for recording my time, but it doesn't tell me how it is helping me get better at time management. I can't see the point of doing it anymore. I'll probably save more time by *not* using it.

Solution:
> Be very explicit about exactly how your app will help the user become good at what they care about. Explain the method behind your madness! And make sure that everything your app does **is** geared toward helping the user master their chosen endeavor.

### Help them with progress and payoffs

In addition to reducing the derailing impact of roadblocks for our users, we should also help them keep their motivation when they are feeling that "This is going to take me *forever* to become good at!"

Two key ways we can do this are by providing users with a clear path to mastery (progress) and the experience of the benefits of getting better (payoffs).

#### Progress

To keep users engaged and encouraged, provide them with a descriptive overview of their path to mastery and continual feedback/updates about where they are in this process.

> To create a mastery path: "Make a list of key skills ordered from beginner to expert, then slice them into groups to make ranks/levels. For motivation, the earlier, lower levels should be achievable in far less time and effort than the later, advanced levels. One possibility is to have each new level take roughly double the time and effort of the previous level."

- great example is the martial arts belts system: shows a clear progression of skills and what is needed to get to the next stage
- make sure that your progression map is performance/skills-based and highlights what users should be able to *do* at each stage, not what they should *learn*
- seeing that you are making progress **is motivating**. (It's not about the belt, it's about what the belt represents: that you are making progress.)

#### Payoffs

The opportunities to use the skills they've built so far should come early and often. Users should feel like they are masters of *this stage* of the process for whichever stage they are at. They should see some meaningful benefit to attempting this endeavor, and to using your tool, within 30 minutes of beginning.

- users may feel fear when they first attempt something, so anticipate and compensate these fears--reassure the user they won't break anything, that it is safe to experiment, recovery will be easy
- ask: "What’s the smallest step they can take that leaves them feeling more creative, smart, powerful, capable? What’s the smallest step that gives a hint of future power?"
- focus on intrinsic ("I can use professional jargon now; I'm an insider! I actually *understand* what this stack overflow post is saying!"), not extrinsic ("I just got five badges to share on Facebook") rewards

> "The ideal user path is a continuous series of loops, each with a motivating next superpower goal, skill building work with exposure-to-good-examples, followed by a payoff. Payoffs are not external rewards; they’re the hard-earned benefits of effort.""

## Reduce Cognitive Resource Leaks

We've learned more about how we can help our users get better and how we can keep them wanting to get better. But we can't do either of these things if our users's cognitive resources are drained. So we need to design our tool in a way that respects our users's attention, time, and energy.

Learning new skills and developing expertise require both focus and willpower. The important thing to know is that *both* focus and willpower use up cognitive resources--concentration and determination both come from the same tank; draining one will drain the other. So we must make our app as intuitive and easy to use as possible so that our users can spend their cognitive resources mastering the context and not trying to figure out our tool.

> "Every moment spent struggling with a confusing UI, frustrating customer service, poor documentation, or anything requiring patience, self-control, or intense concentration on the tool could be stealing resources from learning, practice, and becoming badass at the thing they really care about: the context."

Some key things to note:

- the **Zeigarnik Effect**: unfinished tasks or concerns that linger in the back of our minds ("I'm 98% sure I did this right...") drain cognitive resources
- "knowledge in the world" preserves more cognitive resources than "knowledge in the mind" (a remote control with clearly labeled buttons versus a remote control with unlabeled buttons but a description in the user manual for what they do that you need to memorize)
- the "power of affordances": make the right thing to do the most likely thing to do (make the right thing to do easy and obvious; make the wrong thing to do difficult and unintuitive)
- choices are cognitively expensive: give users fewer choices and they'll spend less time deciding and second-guessing
- deliberate practice is cognitively draining, so make everything *around* practicing easy to do (suggest practice hacks, tracking apps, consistent reminder system, building habits/routine, etc.)
- design your tool as though your users *had absolutely no willpower*; what would your tool have to do in order to help your user make progress in their chosen context
- help users build an identity around their context: if someone thinks of herself as a runner, it makes it easier for her to get up in the morning and run (which still requires willpower, but less willpower than if she didn't have that identity)
- help your user pay attention (help your app's content to escape the brain's spam filter) by getting the brain to agree that "this matters, I should pay attention and remember it". To do so, remember and incorporate **what brains care about**:
    - scary, threatening things
    - faces showing strong emotions
    - young, helpless things (cue the puppy and kitten photos)
    - things that cause feelings (even if we don't know why), emotional responses
    - odd, surprising, unexpected things
    - cliffhangers ("what happens next?"); the Zeigarnik effect can also be a useful tool
    - visceral examples relevant to your domain:
    > "Though you could get their attention with something totally unrelated to what they’re trying to learn, it’s far better for learning and retention if the feeling you evoke to get their attention is about what you want them to remember."

- present the important info *first*. Rivet the users's attention (don't expect them to invest minutes of reading before they "get to the interesting/impactful part")
- reduce the content that you present; if it is not absolutely necessary for the user to know this, then don't waste their attention on it. Not sure if it's necessary? When in doubt, cut it out! Don't use "intellectual curiosity" as an excuse to leave it in
    - put each topic on trial: *why* must our user know it?
    - map that knowledge to a skill: verify that you absolutely can't do this vital skill you need to be able to do *without* this information
- present information **just-in-time** not just-in-case. Any necessary facts that users need to know should be presented at precisely the moment *when they will use that information*. Don't tell users about something that may be useful later on; tell them about it only when they will need it

## Conclusion

Design our app for the experience we want users to have *after* using our app; for how it can help them become not just badass at the domain for which they are using our app, but for how it can help them become badass at life. Ask ourselves about the use of our app:
> "What did that experience **enable**? What can they now **do**? What can they now **show others**? What will they **say** to others? How are they now **more powerful**? 
What happens *after* the UX drives our success. It’s what drives our users to talk about and recommend us, and it’s what leaves our users so obviously better that they might not need to."
