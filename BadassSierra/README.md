# Notes from Kathy Sierra's **Badass: Making Users Awesome**

## Why should we make our users badass?

Short answer: Because this is what drives the success of our product; what makes it desirable to our audience.

Long answer: We want our tool to make our users badass at the context for which they are using our tool (e.g., if we have an education app, we want to make our users awesome at the skills they are using our app to learn) because this is what makes users recommend our tool/app to everyone they know (and those they don't know). It also makes our app speak for itself when others see the work these badass users have done with the aid of our tool.
