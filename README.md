# Why Commonplaces?

This repo is my commonplace book. What's a "commonplace book", you say? Here's Wikipedia to the rescue:

> Commonplace books (or commonplaces) are a way to compile knowledge, usually by writing information into books. Such books are essentially scrapbooks filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts they have learned. Each commonplace book is unique to its creator's particular interests.

I'm collecting the scraps of knowledge gleaned from my reading life here because my recall of even life-changing, vitally-important books *totally sucks*. I have limited RAM in my brain, so this is my way of storing this info for later retrieval. I also think some of it will be useful to you, dear reader. So, peruse and learn at your leisure!
